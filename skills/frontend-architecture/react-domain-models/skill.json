  "inputs": {},
  "guarantees": [
    "Data transformation from API/shape A to view-facing shape is done in a dedicated place (domain object, mapper, or factory), not inline in components or hooks",
    "Derived values and flags (e.g. isDefault, label, display text) are exposed via domain object getters/methods, not computed in JSX or repeated conditionals",
    "Null/empty handling and fallbacks are defined in the domain or data layer, not scattered in the view",
    "Domain objects are UI-agnostic and testable without rendering"
  ],
  "non_goals": [
    "Requiring classes; plain objects with functions or modules can serve as domain models",
    "Moving every tiny conditional into a model when it is purely presentational"
  ],
  "notes": "Logic leaks in the view (e.g. method.provider === 'cash' in JSX) scatter rules and make changes harder. Centralize in a PaymentMethod-like object that exposes provider, label, isDefaultMethod, etc. Reference: 'Modularizing React Applications with Established UI Patterns' – Data modelling to encapsulate logic (https://martinfowler.com/articles/modularizing-react-apps.html)."
