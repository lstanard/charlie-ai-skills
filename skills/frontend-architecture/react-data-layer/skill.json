  "description": "Extract network and data access into a dedicated client or service layer so components and hooks do not call fetch/API directly; keeps data source swappable and testable.",
  "triggers": [
    "fetch in useEffect",
    "API call in component",
    "data layer",
    "network client",
    "where to fetch data React",

  "inputs": {},
  "guarantees": [
    "HTTP/API calls are made from a dedicated module (e.g. paymentMethodApi, orderService), not from inside useEffect in components or from hooks that are primarily UI state",
    "Hooks or domain layer call the data-layer API; the data layer returns raw or minimally shaped data; domain/models handle mapping to view-facing types where appropriate",
    "Data layer can be swapped (e.g. mock, different endpoint, cache) without changing components or domain logic",
    "URLs, headers, and request construction live in the data layer, not in components"
  ],
  "non_goals": [
    "Mandating a specific HTTP library or cache strategy",
    "Moving one-off fetch calls in a tiny app into a full abstraction when there is no need to swap or test"
  ],
  "notes": "Push the design a bit further: extract a network client so that usePaymentMethods (or similar) calls something like fetchPaymentMethods() from a client, rather than containing fetch() and URL logic.
